Cohort analysis is a powerful analytical technique used in business, marketing, and data analysis to understand and track the behavior and performance of specific groups of users or customers over time. The goal of cohort analysis is to gain insights into how different cohorts (groups) of users or customers behave, interact with a product or service, and how their behavior changes over their lifecycle.
